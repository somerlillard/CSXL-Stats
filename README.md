# Computer Science Experience Labs Statistics Project

Hello! The following files contain code for the final project of my COMP 590- Introduction to Software Engineering Course. In this project me and three teammates created a Statistics functionality for the CS Lab's website which allows Lab Ambassadors to search a range of dates for student check-in data, save commonly searched date queries, share these saved queries to the public (AKA all students so they can see check-in data), and all students can view their own personal check-in history. This project was mainly coded with Typescript, Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
"The Experience Labs' (XL) mission is to accelerate technical experience and build community among undergraduate CS majors at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The XL's web app, found in production at `csxl.unc.edu`, is backed by this repository."
